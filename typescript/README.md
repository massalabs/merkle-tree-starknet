# Overview
Deno allows the call of Rust functions from JS/TS easily

## Installation
```shell
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh
```
See https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/ for details


## Warning
They're some limitation with TS support
https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/advanced/typescript/overview

We need to check they're ok for us

## Dumb test
```shell
./run.sh
```
